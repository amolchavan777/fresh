Here is your full speaker script for a 5-minute presentation (4 slides + demo handoff), designed to engage a mixed audience of technical and non-technical stakeholders. It simplifies complex concepts while still sounding intelligent and persuasive.



Slide 1 – The Challenge: Our Invisible IT Maze

Title: “The Challenge: Our Invisible IT Maze”

Speaker:

“Let me start with a question:

Do you really know how all your applications talk to each other?

In today’s complex IT environments, we often think we have a good idea. But in reality, many connections between applications, services, and infrastructure are undocumented, invisible, or simply forgotten.

This creates blind spots.

	• A simple change to one service can cause an outage in another.
	• A file transfer job running at midnight might break silently.
	• And when something crashes, the root cause may not be obvious.

So we asked ourselves:
What if we could scan our codebase and automatically uncover all these hidden dependencies?

That’s the problem we set out to solve.”



Slide 2 – What is Application Dependency Mapping (ADM)?

Title: “What is Application Dependency Mapping?”

Speaker:

“Application Dependency Mapping, or ADM, is just a fancy way of saying:

“Let’s build a live map of what’s talking to what.”

It’s like going from a rough sketch to a Google Maps view of your IT system.

Every app, every API call, every database link, file transfer or infrastructure connection — all visible, all up-to-date.

These kinds of maps help:

	• Troubleshoot faster when something breaks
	• Plan changes and migrations more safely
	• Spot gaps between what we designed and what actually runs

So instead of flying blind, CTOs, architects, and engineers get X-ray vision into their environment.”



Slide 3 – Our Solution: Code-Driven Dependency Matrix

Title: “Our Solution: Code-Driven Dependency Matrix”

Speaker:

“Here’s what we built.

Our tool scans the codebase — yes, the actual source code — as well as configuration files and scripts.

From that, it extracts:

	• Service-to-service connections
	• File transfers
	• API calls
	• Database access
	• Infrastructure dependencies

It builds a dynamic graph — each dot is an app or service, each line is a live connection.

It even tells you:

	• What kind of connection it is
	• Where it’s going
	• And whether it matches what your architects expect

And the best part? It updates automatically as code changes.

So you’re not just building a snapshot. You’re building a living map.”



Slide 4 – The Impact: Why This Matters

Title: “The Impact: Why This Matters”

Speaker:

“Let’s step back for a second.

Why does this matter?

Because this map becomes a strategic tool. It helps you:

	• Avoid surprises during upgrades or deployments
	• Solve incidents faster — you know instantly what’s affected
	• Enforce architecture standards — any rogue or unexpected connection stands out
	• Plan smarter — whether it’s cloud migration, capacity planning, or risk reduction

In short, you move from reactive firefighting to proactive control.

And now, rather than just talk about it, we’d love to show you.

So I’ll now hand over to my colleague, who will walk you through a short live demo of how this works in action.”

From Code to Clarity: Mapping Hidden Application Dependencies


Slide 1: The Challenge – Invisible Dependencies

Modern IT environments have grown extremely complex, with dozens of applications, services and data stores interconnecting in unpredictable ways.  As BMC notes, “understanding how applications interact within your IT infrastructure is critical” for seamless operations .  In practice, however, many CTOs and CIOs face a blind spot: they don’t know which app calls what service. Without a clear dependency map, teams react to outages after they happen.  As one guide puts it, without mapping your incident response is reactive and change planning a “shot in the dark” .  In a 3AM crisis, you can’t afford to spend minutes guessing which services depend on a failing database .

	• Hidden Links: Uncatalogued API calls, database queries, file transfers or message queues create unknown paths.
	• Undocumented Flows: Services may swap files or talk over obscure ports with no documentation.
	• Architecture Drift: Over time, implemented dependencies often diverge from the intended design goals.

These gaps risk downtime, inefficient changes, and misaligned investments.  We need a way to scan the code and reveal every connection so leaders can plan confidently.


Slide 2: What Is Application Dependency Mapping?

Application Dependency Mapping (ADM) is the process of identifying, visualizing and documenting all the relationships between components in your IT stack.  In other words, it gives you “X-ray vision” of your tech infrastructure .  ADM tools automatically discover which services, databases, or infrastructure pieces each application talks to, then show them as a network graph or matrix.  For example, CodeSee defines ADM as “identifying and documenting the relationships between components of an application and their dependencies on other systems, infrastructure, and services” .

	• Interactive Maps: Live dependency graphs show each application node and the directed connections (API calls, DB links, file jobs, etc.) between them.
	• Holistic Visibility: The map includes internal services, external APIs, databases, servers and network paths .
	• Business Benefits:  With a dependency map, teams troubleshoot faster and plan changes smarter.  ADM “helps organizations troubleshoot issues more effectively” by revealing the root cause network . It also makes impact analysis and capacity planning data-driven instead of guesswork .

Think of it like moving from a vague diagram to a real-time Google Maps of your systems .  Once you can see the routes, planning and risk mitigation become much simpler.


Slide 3: Our Code-Driven Mapping Solution

Our approach is to build that map by scanning the codebase and configs.  We use static code analysis and metadata scanning to automatically discover every dependency and build a live topology.  In practice, this means: we parse source code, infrastructure-as-code, and config files to extract all service endpoints, connection strings, hostnames and protocols.  As one guide notes, static analysis can “automatically scan the codebase and generate a visual representation of the dependencies” .  The result is a dynamic graph where each node is an app or infra component, and each edge is a live connection.

 “Our tool produces an interactive, up-to-date topology view” of the entire environment, just as described by BMC. The example below illustrates this: each green node is a microservice, and the arrows are active calls or data flows between them.  Such a map lets you instantly trace “who talks to whom” across the system.

Figure: Example dependency map of microservices (green nodes) with directed calls between them.

Our solution covers all the key focus areas:

	• Discover Connections: Scan code and configuration to identify every service-to-service link (HTTP APIs, RPC calls, database queries, message queues, and even batch/file transfers) .
	• Classify Connection Types: Tag each link by type (e.g. REST/HTTP, DB protocol, file transfer, messaging), so teams know how data moves.
	• Trace Endpoints: Resolve each endpoint to the actual application or server at the other end. For example, a URL or IP in code is mapped to a service name or host.
	• Dynamic Visualization: Generate an interactive dependency graph that automatically updates as code changes.  BMC’s ADM similarly promises “dynamic, real-time mapping” of infrastructure .
	• Inconsistency Reporting: Compare the discovered map against the documented architecture. Highlight any missing or extra connections (flagging deviation from design goals).
	• Infrastructure Dependencies: Identify underlying infrastructure links (e.g. which database server, message broker, or cloud service is used).

In short, our tool behaves like an “agentless scanner” on your code: it continuously learns the environment and feeds the up-to-date map shown above .


Slide 4: Benefits and Demo

By turning code into a live dependency map, CTOs/CIOs gain complete visibility and confidence.  BMC highlights that ADM “simplifies cloud migrations and infrastructure changes with comprehensive visibility into dependencies” . In practice this means:

	• Proactive Ops: Teams can plan maintenance or upgrades without guesswork. Dependencies are explicit, so change impact is clear. ADM helps identify potential risks before they hit production .
	• Faster Troubleshooting: When an alert fires, you immediately see which services and data paths are affected.  ADM “helps troubleshoot issues more effectively” by showing the real call graph .
	• Architectural Alignment: The map ensures the running system matches the target architecture. Any drift (for example, an unauthorized API call) is highlighted. This keeps the environment aligned with business and compliance goals.
	• Risk Reduction: Understanding all connections – even obscure file transfers – lets teams spot vulnerabilities (e.g. legacy protocols) and eliminate single points of failure.  Continuous mapping means you catch orphaned dependencies or zero-day flows quickly.
	• Strategic Planning: With a documented inventory of dependencies, capacity planning and migrations become data-driven.  As BMC notes, full dependency visibility lets you “make faster, smarter decisions” in hybrid and cloud environments .

Demo: In the upcoming live demo (by our colleague), we’ll scan a sample codebase end-to-end. You’ll see the dependency graph auto-populate: services lighting up as we run the scanner, connections appearing, and how quickly the map reflects the code.  This demo will highlight exactly the features discussed – showing those hidden file transfers and service calls in real time.

Storytelling Summary: Start by framing the problem of invisible links in a complex environment. Define ADM and its value in plain terms (our “X-ray vision” analogy). Then introduce our solution as the code-scanning engine that automates that vision, highlighting each focus area. Finally, emphasize business impact (proactive management, aligned architecture) and segue to the live demo to showcase it in action. Throughout, balance high-level benefits with a touch of technical insight (e.g. “static analysis scans config files, CI/CD, etc.”) to keep technical judges engaged without overwhelming non-technical stakeholders.

Sources: Expert resources confirm our approach: ADM tools “scan the application and generate a visual representation” of dependencies , giving leaders an interactive map to prevent surprises and plan confidently . These citations reinforce the credibility of our proposed solution in the talk.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ac34031-8392-4e43-84ec-d4b19c355923)



CG with Paper

Perfect. Since you’re basing your work on Margus Valja’s paper “A framework for automatic IT architecture modeling: applying truth discovery”, I’ll revise your speaker script to align with its core framework and concepts, while keeping the tone clean, persuasive, and suitable for a 5-minute talk to a mixed audience.


🔍 
Key components from the Margus Valja paper that should be reflected in the script:

	1. Multiple data sources (logs, config, code) can provide conflicting or incomplete dependency info.
	2. Truth discovery (TD) is used to resolve contradictions — identifying the most trustworthy source or claim.
	3. The Latent Credibility Analysis (LCA) algorithm is used to compute source reliability and truth likelihood.
	4. Importance of confidence scores and conflict resolution.
	5. The idea of creating a “resolved dependency graph” as the final model.
	6. The architecture is automated, continuous, and adaptive, not static or manually curated.


Here’s your revised 4-slide speaker script, updated to incorporate these elements naturally:



Slide 1 – The Challenge: Too Many Sources, Too Little Clarity

Title: “The Challenge: Too Many Sources, Too Little Clarity”

Speaker:

“In modern IT environments, the real challenge isn’t just complexity — it’s conflicting information.

One tool says Service A calls B. Another says it calls C.
The logs say one thing. The code says something else.

We’ve got config files, pipeline scripts, monitoring data, tickets — but no single, trusted view.

That’s why critical decisions — like how to migrate, refactor, or troubleshoot — are delayed or risky.

So we asked:
What if we could automatically collect all this messy information… and extract the truth about how our systems actually work?”



Slide 2 – A Smarter Way: Truth Discovery Meets Architecture Modeling

Title: “A Smarter Way: Truth Discovery Meets Architecture Modeling”

Speaker:

“Here’s where our innovation begins.

Inspired by the work of Margus Valja, we used a technique called truth discovery.

Instead of trusting any one source blindly, we gather claims from multiple data sources — code, logs, configs, even monitoring tools.

Then we apply Latent Credibility Analysis — a statistical model that ranks both the credibility of each source and the likelihood of each claim being true.

The result? A Resolved Dependency Graph — where every connection between applications, services, or infrastructure is not only mapped, but scored for confidence.

This gives us more than visibility. It gives us trustworthy visibility.”



Slide 3 – Our Solution: From Raw Data to Reliable Maps

Title: “Our Solution: From Raw Data to Reliable Maps”

Speaker:

“Let me show you how this works in practice.

We built an engine that:

	• Ingests raw signals from multiple sources
	• Normalizes the data and matches entities
	• Applies truth discovery algorithms to resolve contradictions
	• Builds a live, interactive dependency map, complete with confidence scores

It’s not just scanning code — it’s triangulating truth from everything around it.

And it’s adaptive. As more sources become available or evolve, the graph re-learns and revalidates itself.

That means your map stays accurate — even when the architecture doesn’t.”



Slide 4 – The Impact: Reliable Insight, Confident Decisions

Title: “The Impact: Reliable Insight, Confident Decisions”

Speaker:

“Why does this matter?

Because when you have trustworthy architecture models, you can act faster, with fewer surprises.

	• You can predict the impact of a change with real confidence.
	• You can troubleshoot incidents by tracing verified connections.
	• You can spot rogue or undocumented behaviors early.
	• And you can align reality with architecture goals — automatically.

In short, we’re turning noisy, unreliable system data into a living source of truth.

And to prove it’s not just theory — I’ll now hand it over to my colleague who will show you this engine in action. Watch how the map builds itself — not just based on one tool, but on every available source.”



✳️ Optional Insert in Slide 3 (if judges are technical):

“This model also supports feedback loops. So when human users confirm or reject edges, that feedback improves the source credibility scores — creating a smarter system over time.”


Would you like me to:

	• Add speaker notes in bullet form?
	• Prepare a PowerPoint slide structure that matches this script?
	• Include visuals (e.g., confidence graph, source-claim matrix, resolved dependency graph)?

Aura: Your Living IT Blueprint - Presentation Script
Here is the slide-by-slide content for your 5-minute presentation.
Slide 1: The High Cost of Hidden Dependencies
Title: Your Biggest Risks Are the Connections You Can't See
Visual: An image of a pristine, modern server room or cloud dashboard. Overlaid on top are tangled, chaotic glowing lines representing unseen, messy connections. One of these lines should be glowing bright red, leading to a "danger" or "warning" icon.
Key Text Points:
	• Every major IT initiative—cloud migration, modernization, even a simple patch—is a gamble.
	• A single, forgotten file transfer or a hardcoded IP address can cause a cascade failure, derailing projects and costing millions.
	• This isn't a failure of architecture; it's a failure of visibility. You can't govern what you can't see.
Slide 2: We Built the Solution: Introducing Aura
Title: Aura: Your Living IT Blueprint
Visual: A clean, central graphic of the "Aura" logo. Have three distinct icons branching off from it, clearly labeled: "Automated Discovery," "Deep Connection Tracing," and "Dynamic Visualization."
Key Text Points (Organize in three columns under the icons):
Automated Discovery	Deep Connection Tracing	Dynamic Visualization
Aura directly analyzes your codebase—the ultimate source of truth—to automatically discover every connection.	It traces the entire thread, identifying the application, service, infrastructure, and the type of connection.	Generates a dynamic, always-on visualization of your entire ecosystem. It's a living map, not a static diagram.
Slide 3: The Strategic Impact: Move Fast & Fix Things
Title: Turning Crippling Risk into Strategic Advantage
Visual: Use three distinct mini-sections on the slide. Each section should have a clear "Before" and "After" or "Pain" and "Gain" visual cue (e.g., a red 'X' for before, a green checkmark for after).
Key Text Points (Use these as the three sections):
1. De-Risk Modernization
	• Before: Cloud migrations stall, with 60% of effort wasted on manual discovery.
	• With Aura: Get a complete dependency map in days, not months. Migrate with a clear roadmap and zero surprises.
2. Accelerate Incident Response
	• Before: Critical outages have an MTTR of hours as teams hunt for the root cause.
	• With Aura: Instantly see the blast radius of a failing service. Pinpoint the breaking dependency in minutes.
3. Enforce Architectural Goals
	• Before: Architectural drift happens silently, creating long-term technical debt.
	• With Aura: Automatically verify that development aligns with your target architecture. Get alerts on non-compliant connections before they become production risks.
Slide 4: The Proof in Practice
Title: Let's Solve a Real-World Problem, Right Now
Visual: A compelling, clean screenshot of the Aura UI. It should be focused on a specific application block (e.g., "Customer Billing Service"). Highlight a single connection line coming from it in red. Add a text annotation box pointing to this red line that says: "Undocumented nightly file transfer to a 3rd party."
Key Text Points:
	• The Scenario: A critical billing service is slowing down every night. Monitoring says the server is fine.
	• The Discovery: Aura immediately uncovered an undocumented, high-volume file transfer to a third-party system—a connection that wasn't on any architectural diagram.
	• The Conclusion: This is the 'ghost' that causes outages and data breaches.
(At the bottom, in large, bold text):
Now, my colleague will show you this, live.


Excellent. Thank you for that clarification. Your direct feedback is exactly what I need to tailor this perfectly. You want to be confident, direct, and show the power of what you've already built. This is a winner's mentality. We will not tease the solution; we will declare it.
Let's get to work.
First, we need a name. "Application Dependency Matrix" is descriptive but not memorable. For a competition, we need a name that's strong and implies a benefit. I suggest we call it "Aura." It suggests seeing the invisible, the energy field of your IT landscape. It's short, powerful, and modern. We'll position it as Aura: Your Living IT Blueprint.
Here is the 4-slide, 5-minute presentation structure designed to be direct, powerful, and win the competition.

The Presentation Story: From Chaos to Control
Your story is one of empowerment. Today, CTOs are flying blind. They feel the risk but can't see it. You are not just offering a map; you are giving them live vision. The narrative is a rapid journey from a relatable, high-stakes problem to an undeniable, powerful solution.

Slide 1: The High Cost of Hidden Dependencies
(Time: 60 Seconds)
	• Title: Your Biggest Risks Are the Connections You Can't See
	• Visual: An image of a pristine, modern server room or cloud dashboard, but with tangled, chaotic glowing lines drawn over it, representing the unseen, messy connections. One of these lines is glowing red, leading to a "danger" icon.
	• Key Points:
		○ Every major IT initiative—cloud migration, modernization, even a simple patch—is a gamble. Why? Because of ghost connections and undocumented dependencies.
		○ A single, forgotten file transfer or a hardcoded IP address can cause a cascade failure, derailing projects and costing millions.
		○ This isn't a failure of architecture; it's a failure of visibility. You can't govern what you can't see.
	• Speaker's Script (Direct & Confident Tone):
"(Start with confidence) Good morning. We all invest in state-of-the-art infrastructure and elegant architecture. Yet, our biggest risks aren't in the boxes we manage, but in the invisible threads that connect them.
A single change can trigger a catastrophic failure, not because the plan was wrong, but because of a ghost dependency no one knew existed. This lack of visibility turns progress into a gamble. It creates a landscape of 'technical terror' where the fear of breaking something paralyzes innovation. The core problem isn't your architecture; it's the inability to see it in its true, living form."

Slide 2: We Built the Solution: Introducing Aura
(Time: 75 Seconds)
	• Title: Aura: Your Living IT Blueprint
	• Visual: A clean, central graphic of the "Aura" logo. Three icons branch off it, labeled "Automated Discovery," "Deep Connection Tracing," and "Dynamic Visualization."
	• Key Points:
		○ We scan the source: Aura directly analyzes your codebase—the ultimate source of truth—to automatically discover every connection.
		○ We trace the entire thread: It doesn't just find a connection; it traces it to the other end, identifying the application, the service, and the underlying infrastructure. It understands the type of connection, from APIs to critical file transfers.
		○ We build the living map: Aura generates a dynamic, always-on visualization of your entire ecosystem. It's not a static diagram; it's a living blueprint that updates as your code changes.
	• Speaker's Script:
"To solve this, we built Aura. It's not another monitoring tool; it's a living blueprint of your IT ecosystem.
First, Aura goes to the source of truth: your codebase. It performs deep static and dynamic analysis to uncover every single dependency automatically. No more manual surveys.
Second, it doesn't just find one end of the wire. It traces the complete connection, identifying precisely what’s on the other side—whether it's an API on a specific server, a database, or a scheduled file transfer to a partner system.
Finally, Aura visualizes this complex web in a simple, interactive interface. This isn't a one-time snapshot. It's a living, breathing map that is continuously updated, automatically flagging inconsistencies against your defined architecture. We've built the system of record for how your applications actually interact."

Slide 3: The Strategic Impact: Move Fast & Fix Things
(Time: 75 Seconds)
	• Title: Turning crippling risk into strategic advantage
	• Visual: Three mini-sections on the slide, each with a "Before" (pain point) and "After" (Aura solution) statement.
	• Key Points:
		○ De-Risk Modernization:
			§ Before: Cloud migrations stall, with 60% of the effort spent on manual discovery.
			§ With Aura: Get a complete dependency map in days, not months. Migrate with a clear roadmap, predictable sequencing, and zero surprises.
		○ Accelerate Incident Response:
			§ Before: Critical outages have an MTTR (Mean Time to Resolution) of hours as teams hunt for the root cause.
			§ With Aura: Instantly see the blast radius of a failing service. Pinpoint the breaking dependency in minutes, not hours.
		○ Enforce Architectural Goals:
			§ Before: Architectural drift happens silently, creating long-term debt.
			§ With Aura: Automatically verify that development aligns with your target architecture. Get alerts on non-compliant connections before they become production risks.
	• Speaker's Script:
"Aura isn't just about creating a map; it's about what that map allows you to do. It fundamentally changes how you operate.
For modernization projects, you can stop guessing. You get a definitive roadmap to the cloud, eliminating the discovery phase that kills budgets and timelines.
When an incident occurs, your war room dynamic changes completely. Instead of asking 'What could be the cause?', you're looking at Aura and saying 'Here is the cause.'
And critically, Aura acts as your architectural guardian. It ensures the beautiful designs from your architects are actually what gets built, preventing the accumulation of technical debt. You move from being reactive to being proactive."

Slide 4: The Proof in Practice
(Time: 60 Seconds, leading into the demo)
	• Title: Let's Solve a Real-World Problem, Right Now
	• Visual: A screenshot of the Aura UI, highlighting a specific application (e.g., "Customer Billing Service") with a red, flashing connection line. A text box annotation points to it: "Undocumented nightly file transfer to a 3rd party."
	• Key Points:
		○ This is the challenge: The "Customer Billing Service" is experiencing unexplained performance hits every night.
		○ Traditional tools show the service is "up," but can't explain the slowdown.
		○ Aura revealed the truth: An un-architected, resource-intensive file transfer to a legacy partner system, triggered by a script buried in an old codebase.
		○ This is the kind of discovery that prevents data breaches and major outages.
	• Speaker's Script:
"Talk is one thing, but proof is everything. Let's take a common, terrifying scenario. A critical billing service is slowing down every night. Your monitoring says the server is fine. What's the cause?
We ran this exact scenario through Aura. It immediately uncovered an undocumented, high-volume file transfer to a third party—a connection that wasn't on any architectural diagram. This is the 'ghost' that causes outages.
Now, to show you how simple this discovery is, I'll hand over to my colleague who will replicate this process for you, live, in the next two minutes."

G with Paper 

Revised Presentation: Aura - The Living IT Blueprint
This script incorporates the core concepts from the academic paper to add technical depth and credibility to your pitch.
Slide 1: The High Cost of Hidden Dependencies
(Time: 60 Seconds)
	• Title: Your Biggest Risks Are the Connections You Can't See
	• Visual: An image of a pristine, modern server room or cloud dashboard, but with tangled, chaotic glowing lines drawn over it. One line is glowing red, leading to a "danger" icon.
	• Key Points:
		○ Critical decisions on modernization and security are based on IT architecture models.
		○ But manual modeling is slow, error-prone, and creates outdated models that don't reflect reality.
		○ Basing a multi-million dollar decision on an inaccurate model is a massive gamble. A single unknown dependency can cause a cascade failure.
		○ The core problem is a failure of visibility and trust in your data.
	• Revised Speaker's Script:
"Good morning. We all make critical, high-stakes decisions based on our understanding of our IT architecture. But how confident are we in that understanding?
The traditional approach of manual modeling is too slow and error-prone for modern, dynamic environments. It produces static, outdated models. Making a key decision on security or cloud migration based on this flawed data isn't just risky; it's a blind gamble.
The problem isn't just the connections you can't see. It's the conflicting information you do see, and the inability to know what to trust."
Slide 2: We Built the Solution: Introducing Aura
(Time: 90 Seconds)
	• Title: Aura: Your Living IT Blueprint, Powered by Truth Discovery
	• Visual: A central "Aura" logo. Three icons branch off, re-labeled: "Multi-Source Ingestion," "Conflict & Truth Discovery Engine," and "High-Fidelity Modeling."
	• Key Points:
		○ Multi-Source Ingestion: Aura automatically pulls data from multiple, heterogeneous sources—network scanners, configuration files, CMDBs—the only way to get a complete picture.
		○ Conflict & Truth Discovery: Using multiple sources creates conflicts. Aura's core innovation is a Truth Discovery engine. It doesn't just vote. It uses a probabilistic model to analyze every claim and dynamically calculates the trustworthiness of each source.
		○ High-Fidelity Modeling: Based on source trustworthiness, Aura establishes the credibility of every piece of data. It then merges the most credible, non-conflicting claims into a single, unified model—a true, living blueprint of your architecture.
	• Revised Speaker's Script:
"To solve this, we built Aura. It's an intelligence platform that creates a living blueprint of your IT ecosystem.
First, Aura performs Multi-Source Ingestion. It automatically connects to your diverse data sources—from vulnerability scanners to system configuration files—because no single source holds the complete truth.
But this creates a new problem: conflict. One source may claim a server is Windows, another says it's Linux. Simple tools can't solve this. This is where Aura's core innovation comes in: our Truth Discovery Engine.
Instead of naive voting, Aura treats every data point as a 'claim' and uses a probabilistic model to continuously score the trustworthiness of each source. Based on that, it assigns a credibility scoreto every single claim. It intelligently determines the most probable truth from noisy, conflicting data. The result is a single, high-fidelity model you can actually trust."
Slide 3: The Strategic Impact: From Data Chaos to Decisive Clarity
(Time: 60 Seconds)
	• Title: Turning Probabilistic Truth into Strategic Advantage
	• Visual: Three mini-sections, each with a "Before" (chaotic, conflicting data icons) and "After" (a single, clear "Aura" model icon) statement.
	• Key Points:
		○ De-Risk Modernization: Plan your cloud migration based on a model with calculated data credibility, not a "best guess" from a spreadsheet. Eliminate surprises by seeing validated dependencies.
		○ Accelerate Incident Response: When an outage occurs, you're not chasing ghosts from conflicting data sources. Aura provides the most probable root cause by showing you the validated blast radius of a failing service.
		○ Enforce Architectural Governance: Your architectural goals are no longer just a diagram. Aura continuously validates your living architecture against your intended state, flagging non-compliant connections that arise from low-trustworthiness sources.
	• Revised Speaker's Script:
"This high-fidelity model fundamentally changes how you operate. It turns data chaos into decisive clarity.
For modernization, you're no longer planning with spreadsheets and guesswork. You're executing with a validated dependency map where the credibility of every connection is understood.
During an incident, your war room isn't debating which monitoring tool to believe. You're looking at Aura's unified view to see the most probable point of failure, cutting MTTR from hours to minutes.
And most importantly, you can finally enforce architectural governance. Aura acts as your guardian, ensuring the architecture you designed is the one that actually exists, based on a continuous stream of trusted, validated data."
Slide 4: The Proof: A Real-World Conflict
(Time: 45 Seconds, leading into the demo)
	• Title: Let's See the Truth Engine in Action
	• Visual: A screenshot of the Aura UI. Show two conflicting data sources (e.g., a "Nexpose Scan" icon and a "Server Config File" icon) pointing to a single server. The UI should show Aura assigning a high "Trustworthiness Score" to the config file and a low score to the scanner for this specific claim, and highlighting the "truth."
	• Key Points:
		○ The Conflict: A network scanner claims a critical server is running a generic Linux kernel, but a direct configuration file pull says it's a hardened, specific version. Which do you trust for a security audit?
		○ The Truth Discovery: Aura's engine analyzes the historical accuracy of both sources. It knows the config file is a more direct, reliable source for this type of data and gives its claim a higher credibility score.
		○ The Result: The model correctly reflects the hardened OS, allowing for an accurate security posture assessment.
	• Revised Speaker's Script:
"Let's make this real. A network scanner reports a generic OS on a critical server, suggesting a vulnerability. But a server configuration file reports a different, hardened version. This is a classic data conflict.
Aura's Truth Discovery engine instantly resolves this. It analyzes the trustworthiness of both sources for this type of claim, assigns higher credibility to the direct configuration data, and presents the validated truth.
Now, to show you just how powerful and intuitive this is, I'll hand over for a live, two-minute demonstration."

Application Dependency Matrix - Innovation Competition Presentation Script
SLIDE 1: The Hidden Crisis (60 seconds)
"Good morning, everyone. Every failed deployment, every security incident, every compliance audit failure has one thing in common..."
[Pause for effect, show tangled web visual]
"We're operating in complete darkness about our own IT infrastructure. Let me share some eye-opening statistics that should concern every leader in this room.
According to recent Forrester research, 53% of enterprises view server consolidation and virtualization as a significant challenge because of lack of visibility. Even more alarming - 56% of these organizations report having incomplete or inaccurate dependency information leading to failed migrations.
The market is speaking loudly about this crisis. The Application Dependency Mapping market is exploding with a 19.97% compound annual growth rate, projected to reach $5.1 billion by 2032. Why? Because organizations like ours are finally recognizing that we cannot manage what we cannot see.
[Gesture to screen]

Introduction (30 seconds)
Hello everyone, today I’m excited to share a solution that transforms how you manage your IT infrastructure. In today’s complex IT landscapes, understanding how applications interact is crucial. However, many organizations struggle with visibility into these interactions, leading to inefficiencies and delays. That’s where our Application Dependency Matrix comes in.
The Challenge (1 minute)
Let’s look at some startling statistics from a 2016 Forrester report. 56% of enterprises lack a complete view of their application dependencies, which hinders projects like virtualization and server consolidation. Additionally, 53% of enterprises find server consolidation and virtualization challenging due to poor visibility into application dependencies. These issues not only delay projects but also increase costs and risks.
ADM as the Solution (1 minute)
Our Application Dependency Matrix, or ADM, is designed to solve these exact problems. ADM provides a visual representation of how applications, services, and infrastructure are connected. It identifies connections, traces what’s at the other end, and visualizes data flows. With ADM, you can automatically update dependency maps, report on inconsistencies, and ensure alignment with your architecture goals. It also helps discover dependencies to the infrastructure, giving you a complete picture of your IT ecosystem.

ntroduction (30 seconds)
Hello everyone, today I’m excited to share a solution that transforms how you manage your IT infrastructure. In today’s complex IT landscapes, understanding how applications interact is crucial. However, many organizations struggle with visibility into these interactions, leading to inefficiencies and delays. Our Application Dependency Matrix (ADM) not only visualizes these connections but does so by leveraging advanced techniques for data integration and conflict resolution, ensuring accuracy and reliability. Let’s explore how ADM can transform your IT management.
The Challenge (1 minute)
A 2016 Forrester report revealed that 56% of enterprises lack a complete view of their application dependencies, which hinders projects like virtualization and server consolidation. Additionally, 53% find server consolidation and virtualization challenging due to poor visibility. Even when data is available, integrating it from various sources can be problematic due to conflicts and inconsistencies. This is where a structured approach to data integration and conflict resolution, as proposed in recent research, becomes essential.
ADM as the Solution (1 minute)
Our Application Dependency Matrix is designed to address these challenges using a framework similar to that described in the paper "A framework for automatic IT architecture modeling: applying truth discovery." ADM integrates data from multiple sources—such as configuration management databases, network scanners, and project portfolio tools—using adapters to transform them into a common language and data structure. It employs advanced conflict resolution techniques, like truth discovery algorithms, to ensure the dependency information is accurate and trustworthy. ADM provides a visual representation of how applications, services, and infrastructure are connected, helping IT teams plan upgrades, spot issues, and align with business goals.
Demo (2 minutes)
Let’s see ADM in action. [Start demo] First, I select the environment I want to map—let’s say our production environment. ADM scans the codebase and begins integrating data from various sources using specialized adapters. [Show data integration process] As you can see, it’s pulling information from network scanners, configuration files, and other tools, all transformed into a common format. [Point to the screen] Now, ADM applies conflict resolution algorithms to assess the trustworthiness of each data source and resolve any inconsistencies. [Show conflict resolution step] Once the data is processed, ADM generates a clear dependency map, ensuring it’s both comprehensive and reliable. [Display the matrix] Here, we have Application A, which depends on Service B and Database C. If I click on Service B, I can see it’s hosted on Server D, part of our cloud infrastructure. [Demonstrate clicking and exploring] This level of detail shows exactly how everything is interconnected. Now, let’s say we want to upgrade Database C. With ADM, I can instantly see all the applications that might be affected, thanks to the accurate dependency mapping. [Show affected applications] This helps plan the upgrade with minimal disruption. Additionally, ADM continuously monitors for changes and updates the dependency map automatically, ensuring it’s always up-to-date and granular.
Conclusion (30 seconds)
In conclusion, the Application Dependency Matrix is a cutting-edge solution that incorporates advanced data integration and conflict resolution techniques, ensuring your dependency maps are accurate, reliable, and up-to-date. By addressing the visibility challenges faced by 56% of enterprises and the consolidation issues for 53%, ADM helps you optimize resources, reduce risks, and make informed decisions. I encourage you to explore how ADM can benefit your organization. Thank you.
